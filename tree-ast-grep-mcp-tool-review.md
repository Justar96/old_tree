## Detailed Test Results

### 1. ‚úÖ Simple AST Searches - **EXCELLENT**

**What was tested:**
- Basic function name searches: `def create_parser()`
- Import statement searches: `import $MODULE`
- Method call searches: `logger.$METHOD($_)`

**Results:**
- **Perfect accuracy** in finding basic patterns
- **Fast execution** (9-22ms typical)
- **Clean output** with precise line/column information
- **Good context display** with configurable surrounding lines

**Example Success:**
```python
# Pattern: logger.$METHOD($_) 
# Found 20 matches across src/main.py in 19ms
logger.info(f"Starting Face Recognition System - {config.recognizer_type} - {config.source}")
logger.debug(f"Processor type detection: has_process_stream={...}")
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Metavariable Patterns - **EXCELLENT**

**What was tested:**
- Single node captures: `$VAR`, `$NAME`, `$METHOD`
- Multi-node captures: `$$$`
- Parameter captures: `$ARGS`

**Results:**
- **Reliable pattern matching** with metavariables
- **Accurate capture** of variable content
- **Flexible usage** across different code constructs

**Example Success:**
```python
# Pattern: def $NAME(): $$$
# Successfully found functions with no parameters
def simple_func():
    return True
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Constraint-based Searches - **VERY GOOD**

**What was tested:**
- Regex constraints on metavariables
- Filtering logger calls by method type
- Complex rule composition

**Results:**
- **Effective filtering** using regex patterns
- **Rule generation** works well with `ast_run_rule`
- **JSON output** format is clean and structured

**Example Success:**
```yaml
# Generated rule with constraints
constraints:
  METHOD:
    regex: "(error|warning)"
# Found 5 error/warning logger calls out of 20 total
```

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex Pattern Matching - **LIMITED**

**What was tested:**
- Full function definitions: `def $NAME($ARGS): $$$`
- Contextual patterns with `inside` and `has`
- Multi-line complex structures

**Results:**
- **Mixed success** with complex patterns
- **Contextual matching** (`inside`, `has`) appears unreliable
- **Function parameter patterns** inconsistent

**Issues Encountered:**
```python
# This pattern failed to match:
def $NAME($ARGS): $$$
# Against this code:
def create_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser:
    """Create simplified argument parser for core functionality."""
    # ... function body
```

### 5. ‚úÖ AST Replacements - **EXCELLENT**

**What was tested:**
- Simple method call replacements
- Variable assignment transformations
- Dry-run preview capabilities

**Results:**
- **Outstanding diff previews** showing exact changes
- **Reliable replacements** for simple to moderate patterns
- **Safety features** with dry-run mode
- **Clear change statistics**

**Example Success:**
```diff
# Pattern: logger.info($MSG) ‚Üí logger.debug($MSG)
- logger.info("Starting process")
+ logger.debug("Starting process")
# 2 matches replaced successfully
```

### 6. ‚úÖ Real-world Refactoring - **EXCELLENT**

**What was tested:**
- Replacing magic numbers with constants
- Directory-wide pattern searches
- Code quality improvements

**Results:**
- **Identified 6 hardcoded `cv2.waitKey(1)` calls** for constant replacement
- **Perfect replacement preview** showing all affected locations
- **Scalable across directories** (tested on entire `src/` folder)
- **Practical value** for actual codebase improvements

**Real Refactoring Opportunity Found:**
```python
# Found 6 instances of hardcoded cv2.waitKey(1)
# Can be replaced with cv2.waitKey(GUI_KEY_DELAY)
# Perfect candidate for improving code maintainability
```
